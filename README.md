This is a Library that I am making to put custom commands in, to help myself with custom code.

MyMath contains the following functions:
    average(Double[]): finds the average of an array of doubles, returns a double
    stdDev(Double[]): finds the standard deviation of an array of doubles, returns a double
    findMin(Double[]): finds the minimum in an array of doubles, returns a double
    findMax(Double[]): finds the maximum in an array of doubles, returns a double
