This is a Library that I am making to put custom commands in, to help myself with custom code.

MyMath contains the following functions:<br />
<ul>
<li>average(ArrayList): finds the average of an arraylist of doubles, returns a double </li>
<li>variance(ArrayList): finds the variance of an arraylist of doubles, returns a double</li>
<li>stdDev(ArrayList): finds the standard deviation of an arraylist of doubles, returns a double </li>
<li>findMin(ArrayList): finds the minimum in an arraylist of doubles, returns a double </li>
<li>findMax(ArrayList): finds the maximum in an arraylist of doubles, returns a double </li>
</ul>
